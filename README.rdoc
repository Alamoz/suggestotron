This is the Suggestotron Rails app developed in the intermediate level
Rails training workshop held at Tapjoy in San Francisco on October 19, 2013.
The class was exceptional: the students were sharp, focused and persistent.
We ended up completing the intermediate curriculum, and had time to add
Up-voting and Down-voting, as well as adding a method to the Topic model to
return an overall rating of topics by subtracting the Down-votes from the
Up-votes. Very cool.
